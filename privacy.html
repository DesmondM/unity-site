            <p  class="para-3" > 
                Protection of your personal data is very important to us, and we follow reasonable industry standards to ensure the proper treatment of personal data in accordance with applicable data protection

                Personal data refers to any data (whether by itself or when linked with other information in the possession of, or likely to come into our possession) that can be used to identify a specific living

                This Policy applies to our Website and all Services that we offer. This Policy does NOT apply to any website, product or service of any third-party, even if the website links to (or from) our website. We 
                suggest that you review the privacy practices of any third-party who may be handling your personal data before deciding whether to provide personal information. We are not responsible in any way 
                for third-party sites or the collection or protection of your personal information on those sites.

                Other than through the process of signing up for our Services, we do NOT collect personal data on our Website. We collect personal data from our service providers (which include application developers working on their behalf) when you provide it directly to us by interacting with our Services, but we will only collect personal information that is necessary for us to provide the Services to you. We 
                do NOT collect personal data from our service providers’ end customers.

                Any personal data collected will be shared and disclosed as described below (“Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Data”). If you provide personal data to us via use of the Services – for example to create 
                end user authentication certificates – you consent to our collection and use of personal data as described in this Privacy Policy, and we will not be liable for any damages that result from your failure to 
                anonymize provided data.

            <p  class="para-3" > 
                If you provide personal information from third parties, you are responsible for obtaining the appropriate and necessary consents for provision of such information to us. As a result, we disclaim all liability for claims brought by a data subject arising from any action or omission by us to the extent that such action or omission resulted from your failure by you to obtain necessary consents from your 
                customers as required by law.
