                <div class="listed" style="width: 50%;">
                    Platform engineering is an emerging technology approach that can
                    accelerate the delivery of applications and the pace at which they
                    produce business value. It improves developer experience and
                    productivity by providing self-service capabilities with automated
                    infrastructure operations. This accelerates a product team’s delivery
                    of customer value.
                    Platform engineering implements reusable tools and self-service
                    capabilities with automated infrastructure operations. For the
                    developer, it provides relief from the management of delivery
                    pipelines and low-level infrastructure. It allows IT to stay better
                    connected to business value, and business to gain better insight
                    into the cost centre of IT.
                    Organizations that use CI/CD methodology find that they work well
                    with simple workflows. But things start getting more complex and
                    time-consuming whenever they need to do anything beyond this
                    basic workflow, such as:
                    • Adding environment variables and changing configurations
                    • Adding services and dependencies
                    • Rolling back and debugging
                    • Spinning up a new environment
                    • Refactoring Adding/changing resources
                    • Platform engineering is about binding all of this into a paved road.
                    Platform engineering is intended to modernize enterprise software
                    delivery, particularly for digital transformation.

                <p class="para-2" style="width: 50%;">
                    The platform uses APIs as
                    the consistent way to
                    access different cloud
                    providers and third-party
                    offerings. APIs make
                    continuous modularization
                    possible. APIs are the foundation of
                    self-service tools, services, knowledge and
                    support. With an API-first approach, companies
                    use APIs as their product’s key element in how they go to
                    market.
                    The platform creates a golden path in the software development
                    life cycle that a user can follow with minimal cognitive load and that
                    drives standardization.
                    What makes a platform compelling:
                    • It is self-service for the overwhelming majority of use cases
                    • It is composable, containing discrete services that can be used
                    independently
                    • It does not force an inflexible way of working on the delivery team
                    • It is quick and cheap to start using, with an easy on-ramp
                    (Quickstart guides, documentation, code samples, etc.)
                    • It is secure and compliant by default
